# Corral QAI Experiment

This repo contain a big dataset (more than 4000 observations) of public fragments
of python code extracted from: [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/), 
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and [ActiveState](http://code.activestate.com/).
Used for estimate the most common number of errors of **any** python file (tau).

This value is used as default tolerance for the [Corral](https://github.com/toros-astro/corral) 
Quality Assurance Index (QAI).

Yo can see more about this in the paper:
